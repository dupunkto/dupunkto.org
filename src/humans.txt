Hi. We're Axcelott and MSB, the founders of this thing.

We firmly believe everything should be open and usable for 
everyone. Therefore, we release our work in the public 
domain and license our code Unlicense. However, we would 
like to request you not to use our work for any purpose 
related to the creation of a machine learning model or 
ancillary technologies, generally referred to under the 
umbrella term of "AI".
