    <h1>Improving the world line by line, using code.</h1>

    <p>
      {du}punkto is a small hacker<sup><small>*</small></sup> collective ran by
      two teenagers (<a href="//geheimesite.nl">Robin</a> and
      <a href="/~potsjem">Potsjem</a>) from the Netherlands. We collaborate on code,
      experiment, and, above all, we're having fun doing it. We aspire to make a
      positive impact on the world by writing great software.
    </p>

    <p>
      On this site, we host some of our projects, 
      <a href="//wiki.dupunkto.org">our wiki</a>,
      <a href="//git.dupunkto.org">our repos</a>
      and services needed to develop and maintain all that.

        <a href="//www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/hacker.html">Hacking</a> is a
        widely misunderstood word. Originally it meant "To program (a computer)
        for pleasure or compulsively". Only later it got a second meaning:
        "especially, to try to defeat the security systems and gain unauthorized
        access to a computer."

    <h2>Why?</h2>

    <p>
      We initially founded {du}punkto as a pubnix, which we created out of
      curiousity and desire to learn more about *NIX systems. Unfortunately,
      we've had to close it down due to lack of interest and, crucially,
      funding. We're still writing code tho!
    </p>

    <h2>What's with the name?</h2>

    <p>
      {du}punkto is derived from the Esperanto word <dfn>dupunkto</dfn>, which
      means <i>colon</i>. We aim to be the beginning of something, instead of
      the end (a semicolon indicates the end of a statement in a lot of
      programming languages).
    </p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>

    <p>We love a good conversation; don't hesitate to shoot us an email.</p>

    <p>
      {du}punkto is primarily maintainted by Robin. Find him and his contact
      details on <a href="//geheimesite.nl">his personal site</a>.
